# UltimateCollectersApplication
Did a lot of work on the GUI. Finished the GUI for the home page welcoming the user. Finished the login page which is fully functional now. Added a class that handles the
connection to the database. What still needs to be done is the GUI for the Discover page and the collection page, I would also like to add a GUI for the user to view and
update their profile if I have time we will see if that gets done.
